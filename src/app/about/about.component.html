<p>I'm Swapnil Solanke, currently working as Sr. Software engineer. I passionately move pixels and lines of code to craft clean, and user-friendly websites. My current weapons of choice are HTML5, CSS3, Angular 2+, VUE, React, KendoUI, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript. Basically JS and JS frameworks, libraries are the one of my first choice. Love to explorer possibilities and technologies. When I'm not in the mood of coding, you'll find me in a quit room with book :)</p>
